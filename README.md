# SIP-Calculator
A Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) calculator helps you estimate the future value of your investments when you invest a fixed amount regularly in a mutual fund. It uses compound interest to calculate potential returns based on the expected rate of return and investment duration.

SIP Formula
The SIP maturity amount is calculated using the formula:

ùê¥= P√ó(((1+r)^n)-1)/r)√ó(1+r)
Where:

A = Maturity amount
P = Monthly investment amount (SIP)
r = Monthly rate of return (Annual Rate √∑ 12 √∑ 100)
n = Number of months
